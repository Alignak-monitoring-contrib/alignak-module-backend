install:

# command to run tests
# notice: the nose-cov is used because it is compatible with --processes, but produce a .coverage by process
# so we must combine them in the end
script:
  - pip freeze  # so to help eventual debug: know what exact versions are in use can be rather useful.
  # Code static analysis

  - cd test
  # Delete previously existing coverage results

  # to get coverage data with relative paths and not absolute we have to
  # execute coveralls from the base directory of the project,
